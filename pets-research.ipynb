    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the fascinating area of pet adoption, specifically considering dogs and cats, the two most popular pets. Using data obtained from Petfinder, an online, searchable database of animals who need homes, we're looking to uncover trends and factors affecting adoption rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the Petfinder dataset of over 30,000 records, we'll examine key aspects such as the type of pet (dog or cat), breed, age, gender, and size. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on what drives pet adoption and identify potential opportunities to increase adoption rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we will document our process from start to finish, detailing how we gathered, cleaned, and analyzed the data. We are particularly interested in answering questions like: Which breeds are most common in the adoption pool? How does a pet's age impact its likelihood of being adopted? Is a pet's gender a significant factor in adoption?\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights generated from this analysis will not only add to our understanding of pet adoption trends but also provide valuable information to both potential adopters and animal shelters."

    "## 2. Data Acquisition\n",
    "The data for this project was gathered through web scraping, which is a practical way to extract data from websites. For this specific task, the Python library requests was instrumental in sending HTTP requests to the Petfinder's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon receiving the JSON response, I parsed it to extract the relevant details. This resulted in a dataset of over 30,000 records for dogs, including valuable attributes such as pet type, breed, age, gender, and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of obtaining the data involved requesting an API key from Petfinder, allowing me to access their database programmatically. By running a Python script, I was able to navigate through pages of pet data and aggregate the information about all available pets for adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this data collection, we have laid a strong foundation for our exploratory analysis to identify trends and patterns in pet adoption rates.\n",
